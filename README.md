# cmdbclusteR
Some R scripts for clustering patient data from CMBD. The code is very primitive and would need to be refactored properly with functions.  Scripts usually takes a file as input and create new files as output, with a proper workflow that takes from the original CMBD file to the output csv file with the clustering results.
